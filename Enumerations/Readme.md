# Enums in C#

Now letâ€™s look at enums in C#. An enum, short for enumeration, is a way to give meaningful names to numeric constants.

This makes our code easier to read and less error-prone compared to using raw numbers.

## 1. Declaring an Enum

We start with:

```csharp
public enum DaysOfWeek
{
    Sunday,    // 0
    Monday,    // 1
    Tuesday,   // 2
    Wednesday, // 3
    Thursday,  // 4
    Friday,    // 5
    Saturday   // 6
}
```

By default, enums are backed by integers, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1.

So Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, and so on.

This is useful when working with sets of related constants.

 ## 2. Using an Enum

```csharp
DaysOfWeek today = DaysOfWeek.Wednesday;
Console.WriteLine($"Today is: {today}");
Console.WriteLine($"Today's int value: {(int)today}");
```

Here today is set to Wednesday.

Printing today shows the name: Wednesday.

Casting it to (int) gives the underlying value: 3.

## 3. Casting from Int to Enum

```csharp
int dayValue = 1;
DaysOfWeek tomorrow = (DaysOfWeek)dayValue;
Console.WriteLine($"Tomorrow is: {tomorrow}");
```

Enums are really just numbers with labels.

We can cast 1 into DaysOfWeek, and it becomes Monday.

## 4. Enums with Custom Underlying Types

We can also define enums with a specific base type:

```csharp
public enum Status : byte
{
    Pending = 1,
    Approved = 2,
    Rejected = 3
}
```

Here, Status uses byte instead of the default int.

This saves memory if we know values will always be small.

Example:

```csharp
Status orderStatus = Status.Approved;
Console.WriteLine(orderStatus);         // Approved
Console.WriteLine((byte)orderStatus);   // 2
```

## 5. Converting Enum to String

```csharp
string statusString = orderStatus.ToString();
Console.WriteLine(statusString); // "Approved"
```

Every enum can be converted into its name as a string.

## 6. Parsing String Back to Enum

```csharp
string pendingString = "Pending";
Status parsedStatus = (Status)Enum.Parse(typeof(Status), pendingString);
Console.WriteLine(parsedStatus); // Pending
```

Enum.Parse lets us take a string and turn it back into an enum.

This is common when reading data from files, databases, or user input.

## Summary of Key Concepts

Enum = a set of named constants backed by numbers.

Default underlying type is int, but you can specify others (like byte).

You can cast between enums and numbers.

You can convert enums to strings and parse strings back into enums.

## Why It Matters

Enums make code more readable and less error-prone.

Instead of writing:

```csharp
if (status == 2) ...
```

we can write:

```csharp
if (status == Status.Approved) ...
```

which is much clearer and safer.
